- Keep information about guests and their reservations.
  - Reservations can be done/cancelled via phone, mail or personally at the reception desk.
  - The following information is needed to make a reservation:
    - Information about the guest (name, phone, etc.)
    - Check-in and check-out dates
    - Room type and number of guests
  - Application should not allow reservation when there is no suitable room available.
  - Guests can also come in without prior reservation.
